## How I found it

Honestly I found it pretty difficult. This was my first time using JavaScript and HTML and with a bunch of different files in different languages I found it difficult to track down mistakes if it wasn't obvious.

I started by following a HTML course and an AngularJS course. Then I made a very simple version using a single JS file and a single HTML file, but I decided I wanted to use an SQL database to store the contact data and looking around an ASP.NET model view controller app was a very popular option that had good tutorials for setting it up, so I went with that. This quickly became a lot more complex so I didn't stray too far from the tutorials I used.

There were some other features I wanted to add; mainly an authentication method and dynamic phone number formatting depending on the country. But ultimately other things took a while and I think its about time I call it finished.

Thanks
